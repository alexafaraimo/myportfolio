            Hi, I'm Alexa Faraimo! <img src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/isolated-plumeria-flower-white-background-vector_477392-858.jpg?w=2000" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am the daughter of the chief of Motunui and our island is in a bit of trouble. While I have been in training to lead the people of Motunui since I was a small child, I have 0 years experience sailing the seas or taking on quests to save my people. Have no fear though, I am a quick learner. I am currently on a quest with my pal Maui (yep, that Maui.. the demigod), learning to read the stars to voyage the ocean, defeating Te Ka and restoring the heart of Te Fiti. Follow along to learn about my journey!

          Alexa is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts. 
          She is not afraid to ask questions or to get her hands dirty. 
          She will do what is necessary to get the job done.

          Alexa trusts her soul to make decisions. Even with her family against her,
            she knew what the right decision was to save her people. She followed her
            instinct and surrounded herself with the right people
             to get the job done.

        Alexa has always been fearless and drawn to the sea.
          I saw her on the water's edge on multiple occasions seemingly interacting with the waves as if they
          were an old friend. Her connection to the land, sea, and people in unmatched.
